### x86 Assembly reference
I wrote a easy for read x86 reference for who's is begginer or already have experience with assembly but don't remember some concepts.

## Why i wrote this document?
In 2020 i started to study assembly and found me completely lost because i've not able to find easy to read and resumed content on the Internet, so i think a lot of begginers have the same problem with assembly language. I will update it after i learn more about assembly.
